## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [derive_deftly](https://docs.rs/derive-deftly/latest/derive_deftly/), a proc macro to create derive macros from declarative code.

Thanks to [duelafn](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1319) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

More regressions than improvements this week, caused by a combination of fixes,
refactorings, third-party dependency updates and in general the compiler doing
slightly more work.

Triage done by **@kobzol**.
