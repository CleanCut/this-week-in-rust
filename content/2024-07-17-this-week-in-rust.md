## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [cargo-wizard](https://github.com/Kobzol/cargo-wizard), a cargo subcommand that applies profile and config templates to your Cargo project to configure it for maximum performance, fast compile times or minimal binary size.

Thanks to [Jakub Beránek](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1322) for the suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

[submit_crate]: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

### [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing)
* *No calls for testing were issued this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Fairly quite week with the only pure regressions being small and coming from correctness fixes. The biggest single change came from turning off the `-Zenforce-type-length-limit` check which had positive impacts across many different benchmarks since the compiler is doing strictly less work.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [a2d58197..5572759b](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=a2d58197a766085856504328948c89a33a6a36e8&end=5572759b8d7012fa34eba47f4885c76fa06d9251&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

# Quote of the Week

> I have a dream. A dream that Cargo has its own release cadence, so it is free from the strict stability curse and can then ship major version releases.
